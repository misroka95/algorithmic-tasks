## BinaryGap

The solution to find the longest binary gap in an integer value `N`.

## CyclicRotation

The solution to rotate an array `A`, which means shifting each element to the right by a number of positions equal
to `K`.

## OddOccurrencesInArray

The solution to find an array element which occurs odd number of times.

## FrogJmp

The solution to find the minimum number of jumps for the frog. `X` is the starting position, `Y` is the destination
and `D` is the fixed distance of one jump.

## PermMissingElem

The solution to find the missing array element. An array `A` contains `N` number of elements within the range
[1, ..., N + 1], which means that exactly one element is missing.

## TapeEquilibrium

The `A` array can be divided into 2 parts. The goal is to find the smallest possible absolute difference between the
sums of these 2 parts of the array.

## FrogRiverOne

We have an array `int[] A` (positive values) and variable `int X` (positive value). `A[0]` is the starting position
for the frog. The frog has to jump on successive elements of the `A` array until it visits each value in the
range [1..X].
