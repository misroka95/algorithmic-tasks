### Binary Gap

The solution to find the longest binary gap in an integer value `N`.

### Cyclic Rotation

The solution to rotate an array `A`, which means shifting each element to the right by a number of positions equal
to `K`.

### Odd Occurrences In Array

The solution to find an array element which occurs odd number of times.

### Frog Jump

The solution to find the minimum number of jumps for the frog. `X` is the starting position, `Y` is the destination
and `D` is the fixed distance of one jump.

### Perm Missing Element

The solution to find the missing array element. An array `A` contains `N` number of elements within the range
[1, ..., N + 1], which means that exactly one element is missing.

### Tape Equilibrium

The `A` array can be divided into 2 parts. The goal is to find the smallest possible absolute difference between the
sums of these 2 parts of the array.
